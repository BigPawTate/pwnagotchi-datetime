## Installation

To install, first set your directory for custom plugins in your config file.  
Find or add `main.custom_plugins = "/custom/plugin/directory"` Initially, it may be empty.

After that, add `clock.py` to that folder.
Finally, enable it in your config.toml by adding the following line:

```toml
main.plugins.clock.enabled = true
```

## FAQ

### The plugin doesn't work!

### Does it overlap memtemp?

If memtemp is enabled, it moves the clock over to the side, so it doesn't overlap memtemp.
